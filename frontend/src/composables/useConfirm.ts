// A destructive action asks before it runs, and it asks in the same

// and one dialog. `window.confirm` is the alternative and it is not
// one: it cannot carry a variant, it blocks the event loop, and
// browsers increasingly refuse it outright in cross-origin frames.
//
// One dialog serves the whole application: ConfirmDialog is mounted
// once, near the root, and every caller drives that single instance
// through this module's state. So the state lives at MODULE level, not
// inside the composable function - a per-caller copy would mean the
// prompt a view opened was watched by nobody.
