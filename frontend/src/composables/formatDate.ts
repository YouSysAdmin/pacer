// some locales engines have resolved it to h24 - the cycle that numbers

 * went on counting days forever. A node last seen six weeks back read as

 *
 * The clock guard could not see any of them - it looks for a locale call
 * and these are arithmetic - which is why it now looks for the

 * "6d ago" is an interval a reader holds in their head; beyond that the
