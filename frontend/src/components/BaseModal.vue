// ESCAPE BELONGS TO THE TOP DIALOG, and only to it.
//
// Every open modal listens on `document`, so one press used to reach all
// of them: opening Connection, then New credential, then pressing Escape
// closed BOTH - and on Certificates, dismissing a delete confirmation
// took the detail dialog underneath it with it. Nothing ever reported
// this, because closing two dialogs when you meant to close one looks
// like having pressed the key twice.
//
// A stack in mount order, so the newest wins. It cannot be a z-index or
// a DOM query: two dialogs from different components sit in different
// places in the tree and share one overlay class.
//
// IT HAS TO BE THIS BLOCK, not the one below. A `const` at the top of
// <script setup> is compiled INTO setup(), so every dialog would get a
// stack of its own holding only itself - indistinguishable from no check
// at all, and exactly what the first attempt did. Proven by pressing
// Escape with two dialogs open and watching both close.

// Left to each view, closing one becomes three different things. A bare
// @click.self closes the dialog when a drag that started inside it
// happens to end on the overlay, so selecting text in a field and
// releasing past the edge throws the form away. Escape usually ends up
// unhandled.
//
// Mount it behind v-if, which is what every call site already does with
// its own showX flag. That matters: the keydown listener then lives
// exactly as long as the open dialog. Registering it when the VIEW
// mounts instead means a page with three dialogs arms three Escape
// handlers that fire whether anything is open or not.
