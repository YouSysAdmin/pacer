// A labelled field: label, the control, and whatever guidance goes under
// it.
//
// Errors come from two places and they answer different questions.
//
// `error` is the server's. Every handler behind validation.Bind replies
// with `fields: [{field, rule, message}]` naming the json field it
// refused, and useFieldErrors turns that array back into per-field
// messages instead of one run-on toast.
//
// The other source is the browser, handled here rather than in the views
// because the constraint is already on the control - `type=number`,
// `min`, `max`, `required`. Type letters into a number input and `value`
// comes back empty with `validity.badInput` set, so the model receives
// '' and the page sends a missing field or quietly turns it into 0, with
// nothing on screen to say the value was dropped.
//
// The native check reports on blur, never before the field has been
// touched, and clears as soon as the value is valid. A field that turns
// red while you are still typing the first character is worse than one
// that says nothing.
//
// The control stays in the slot rather than becoming props. These are
// inputs, selects, textareas, checkbox rows and two custom pickers, and
// a component taking a `type` would grow a branch for each.
